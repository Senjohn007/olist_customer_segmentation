🚀 Completed a Customer Segmentation project on the Brazilian Olist e-commerce dataset.

Using RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) and K-Means clustering, I grouped customers into actionable segments like High-Value Loyal, New/Recent, Occasional, and At-Risk.

Key steps: data cleaning, RFM feature engineering, scaling, determining optimal clusters with Elbow Method & Silhouette Score, and PCA-based visualization.

This analysis provides insights for targeted marketing, retention strategies, and business decisions.

Skills: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, clustering, data visualization.
